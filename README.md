# Lip-Coders

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Lip Coders came from when we were brainstorming about ideas surrounding color detection using image processing. From there, we got inspired to focus specifically on people's lip shades because all of us use some type of lip product with different shades for our unique lips. However, how can we figure out the best shade to use? The answer is Lip Coders.

## What it does
Lip Coders is a website that uses the webcam to allow users to tap on their lips to get their lip shade and generate recommendations for lip products for their lip shade ("Getting you the perfect lipstick shade to hack into the world!"). 

## How we built it
We built the front end using HTML, CSS, and Canva, and we built the back end using Python, JavaScript, Flask, JSON, and Open AI for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into were choosing a project idea, implementing Python and OpenCV into HTML, implementing Open AI, and connecting the front-end and back-end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of trying new technologies that we've never tried before, experimenting with new UI skills, successfully implementing Open AI and video camera usage into our project, and solving different problems together as a team.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about using OpenCV, Open AI, image processing, flask, and more, that many of us have not used before the hackathon. 

## What's next for Lip Coders
In the future, we hope to add the option for skin and eye products and have the program detect the face features and get the shades automatically for the user.
